1</span>HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES,<br />
OF HORSHAM,<br />
<span class="smcap">and its vicinity</span></h2>
<p>The ancient town and borough of Horsham, which has generally
been past over in topographical accounts, as a place unworthy of
notice; or lost in the dazzling descriptions, of the
&ldquo;modern maritime Babylon of Sussex,&rdquo; must always
remain a spot, dear to the lover of antiquities, and romantic
scenery.&nbsp; The derivation of its name, has ever continued a
matter of great perplexity; which perhaps may be considered as a
very strong <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>argument, in favour of the antiquity
of the place.&nbsp; Some persons conjecture, that the appellation
is derived from the two Saxon words, hurst, and ham, the first
syllable signifying a wood, and the second a village or
collection of houses: and this opinion seems to be supported by
the known fact, that this part of the county, was formerly one
entire tract of forest land: but again quite as good if not a
superior derivation, may be taken from the two words, Horsa, and
ham, that is the village of, or built by, Horsa.</p>
<p>Horsham has enjoyed the privilege of sending two members to
Parliament, ever since the year 1295: by the passing of the
reform bill, however, one representative was considered
sufficient for the business of the borough.&nbsp; The names of
the persons first elected for the town, were Walter Burgeys, and
Walter Randolf: Robert Henry Hurst esq. is the present
member.</p>
<p><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>The spring assizes for the county, had also long been
held in the Town-Hall of Horsham; but this privilege was
selfishly abstracted from the town, by the inhabitants of Lewes;
and even the county gaol, which has been stationed here, for time
immemorial, is, we understand, to be removed to the all devouring
eastern rival: the quarter sessions however, are still held
here.</p>
<p>Still, notwithstanding, as respects the town, Horsham is
greatly improving: the number of buildings which have been lately
erected, and which are still erecting, are of a new and very
handsome description: the streets are neatly paved, with the
large flat stones procured from the excellent quarries in the
neighbourhood; and the illumination of the streets by gas, which
is being carried on with great spirit and energy, contribute very
greatly to the general respectability <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and good
appearance of the place.</p>
<p>Horsham consists of 4 principal streets, crossing one another
at right angles, with a large square, stretching due N. and S.,
in the centre.&nbsp; The upper part of this square is commonly
denominated the Gaol Green, in consequence of the prison, which
formerly stood at the northern end, but of which two large walls,
now found useful in an adjacent brewery, only remain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p5b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Town Hall"
title=
"Town Hall"
src="images/p5s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The lower portion contains the large and handsome Town-Hall,
of which the annexed sketch will afford some idea: a few years
ago, the appearance which it presented was entirely different,
being built on arches, in a similar manner, to the Council
chamber, at Chichester, and surmounted by a stone with the
inscription &ldquo;Thirty six miles from Westminster
Bridge,&rdquo; engraved thereupon: by the kind liberality of the
Duke of Norfolk, <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>it was completely repaired, and
greatly enlarged; and though no longer applied to its original
purpose, (except in the instance of the quarter sessions) it is
still found very serviceable for lectures, public meetings,
&amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; The north front is embellished by the arms
of royalty, flanked by those of Norfolk and <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Horsham.&nbsp;
On either side of the Hall, is a neat street, only one of which
is a thoroughfare; these meet on the southern side of the
building, in a very handsome and respectable walk, called the
Church Causeway, at the termination of which, is the ancient and
spacious church, (dedicated to St Mary) the approach is rendered
particularly picturesque, by an avenue of lofty lime trees, of
some extent, which leads in a perfectly straight direction, to
the church-yard gateway: the effect of the view from this avenue,
is exceedingly pleasing, particularly of a summer evening, when
the rays of the setting sun cast a beautiful golden tint, upon
the venerable porch, which appears a conspicuous object behind
the portal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p6b.jpg">
<img alt=
"South view of Horsham Church"
title=
"South view of Horsham Church"
src="images/p6s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The northern side of the edifice, though perhaps not quite
equal to the southern, appears to great advantage, though the
modern windows, which have been subsituted in several instances
for others of great antiquity, <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>add greatly to
diminish the general effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p7b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Horsham Church"
title=
"Horsham Church"
src="images/p7s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>On entering the church by the eastern gateway, the interior of
the structure appears to the highest advantage: the large and
beautifully simple communion window, reaching almost from the
basement to the roof, is by no means the least attractive object
of attention; while the handsome appearance of the altar, raised
by a flight of several steps, covered entirely with crimson
cloths, the unusually <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>large extent of the communion rails;
and the numerous beautiful monuments, in every direction, afford
a very elegant appearance, perhaps not to be equalled by any
other parochial edifice in the county.&nbsp; Yet at the same
time, the venerable roof of oaken planks; the large yet highly
sculptured beams which have weathered nearly a thousand years;
the tattered escotcheons; the crested helmets; and the antique
tombs, afford a view at once pleasing and romantic.&mdash;Some
attempt has been made to illustrate this portion of the church,
(the chancel) in the annexed engraving, but no drawing can do
justice to the original building.</p>

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>The roof is supported upon wooden ribs, crossed by others
of the same materials: the joints are covered by ornamented
plates of iron, of very grotesque descriptions: in the nave, the
ribs are almost double the distance apart, of those in the
chancel: the junction of the roof and walls, in the latter
portion of the edifice, are adorned with curious little figures
of horses, foxes, &amp;c. &amp;c. interspersed with stars, and
many other similar devices.</p>
<p>The entire edifice is supported upon eight columns on either
side: three constituting the chance, and the remaining five the
nave: the galleries are particularly neat, more especially that
appropriated to the organ, the whole of the pewing being covered
entirely with green baize.&nbsp; The lancet windows, with which
the church was formerly furnished, have almost all been altered
for others of a later date, except in the clerestory, where <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>they retain their original form.&nbsp; The large east
window, before mentioned, was formerly adorned with no less than
14 coats of arms richly painted.&nbsp; The roof was put up, at
the time that the Norfolks were lords of the borough: in the year
1825, a curious old inscription was discovered upon the summit of
the walls, reaching from one end of the church to the other, but
it was very remarkable, that the centres of all the letters,
(which were about a foot in length) were entirely, and apparently
designedly effaced, so that not the slightest meaning could be
discovered from it.</p>
<p>In the chancel, is the curious and remarkable effigy of Thomas
lord Braose ob. 1396.&nbsp; This noble and ancient family were
formerly almost the sole proprietors of the county of
Sussex.&nbsp; One of their residences was at Chesworth, an
ancient mansion to the <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>south of the town, which shall
afterwards be described; and Bramber Castle also near Steyning,
originally appertained to these powerful barons.&nbsp; The head
of the figure, &ldquo;is defended by a basinet, ornamented by a
draplet of jewels, his throat by the ample carmail, attached to
the helmet as in the time of Edward III.&nbsp; His arms are in
plate armour, <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and his body in a shortened hauberk,
kept from pressing on his chest, by means of the plastron, or
breast-plate, within.&nbsp; Over this is the juppon, bearing his
coat of arms, viz. seme of cross croslets, a lion rampant
crowned.&nbsp; Suspended from his military girdle at his right
hip, is his dagger, the sheath of which, is ornamented in an
architectural style, and in the same manner at the left, hung his
long sword, of which no traces now remain.&nbsp; On his insteps,
are large pieces attached to the spur leathers, and terminated by
indented edges which conceal the chain mail beneath.&nbsp; His
jousting helmet, surmounted by his crest, a demi-lion rampant,
issuing from a coronet, is under his head, but greatly mutilated,
all below the oscularium, having been destroyed.&rdquo; <a

<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>At a very small distance from the above mentioned
monument, is a very beautiful altar tomb of white marble,
relieved alternately by slabs of black: upon this is an admirable
and most elaborately executed figure, of a lady, in long flowing
robes, her right hand reclines upon her breast, while her left
rests upon the Holy Scriptures, in a peculiarly graceful manner:
it is the work of Francis Fanelli, an Italian sculptor, of great
eminence in his day, and has escaped the devastation generally
inflicted on works of art in the parochial edifices of Sussex;
the inscription is as follows.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here lyeth (expecting a joyfull resurction,) the
body of Elizabeth, late wife of Thomas Delves Esquire, son and
heire apparent to Sr. Henry Delves of Dvddington in the Covnty of
Chester, Barronet, who deceased the 2nd day of December 1654,
being somewhat more than 25 yeares old; then in childbed of Henry
their 2nd son, who with Thomas their eldest son did both survive
her.&nbsp; She was enriched with many ornaments, both of mind and
body, and memorable for virtue, in the several relations of her
life, whereunto she was any way engaged, being religious as she
was a Christian, dutiful as a daughter, affectionate as a wife,
tender as a mother, discreete in her family as <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>a Mistris,
charitable in the relation of a neighbour, also of a sweet and
affable disposition and of a sober and winning
conversation.&nbsp; She was the only child of Hall Ravenscroft
Esq.r of this parish, by the mother descended of ye Staplays of
this county.&nbsp; Her sorrowful husband, sadley weighing such a
considerable losse, erected this monument, that an impartiall
memorial of her might bee the better communicated to
posterity.</p>

<p>On the other side of the church, in a portion denominated the
Roffy chancel, is a large, and beautifully sculptured altar-tomb,
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>of Sussex marble, with a light and curious canopy of the
same material, supported upon pillars: on the surface were
formerly a brass inscription, and armorial bearings, but all of
these have disappeared, it is supposed to cover the remains of
Thomas Hoo Knt. <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span

<p>According to Dallaway, mention is made in the visitation book
of Philpot and Owen, A.D. 1634, of two other monuments, not at
present remaining.&nbsp; &ldquo;Under the communion table,</p>
<blockquote><p>Hic jacet William Hoo armiger, qui obiit 2do

<p>Arms, two shields, 1 Covert, impaling a phaon&rsquo;s head: 2
impaling, a chevron, 2 roundlets, in chief a buck&rsquo;s head

<p>Under the organ gallery, is a curious brass of a man and
woman, in the antique dress of the time, with the following
inscription, <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span

<blockquote><p>Here lyeth Richard Foys, and Elizabeth his wife:
which Richard deceased in 21 day of April, MDLCIII.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Affixed to one of the columns supporting the organ gallery, is
a small slab of white marble, with a frame of black: the
inscription in black letter runs thus.</p>

depends entirely upon a large beam in the centre.&nbsp; It is
called the Lollard&rsquo;s tower, and was most probably used as a
place of confinement for that unfortunate sect: the apertures for
light are thickly guarded by double iron bars, and in one place,
on the north wall, the remains of an iron ring are visible: the

&ldquo;was built by Walter Burgess who in the year 1307, obtained
a license to endow with 50 acres of land, a chaplain to celebrate
divine service daily in the parish church of Horsham, for the
souls of himself and his successors.&nbsp; The other was

<p>On the 17th of November 1231, John de Braose granted the
church of Horsham with all its appurtenances, to the prioress and
nuns of Rusper, for their exclusive use; by same deed it was also
ordained, that on account of the size of the parish, and the
number of inhabitants, the vicar who shall officiate in the
church from time to time, shall <!-- page 27--><a

with a gravel walk surrounding a fine grass-plot, and the whole

danger in case of fire, every cell is arched over with brick, and
a separate room allotted to each debtor and felon.&nbsp; The

fell a victim to the malignant jealousy of <!-- page 35--><a

Elizabeth, was apprehended here, A.D. 1571.&nbsp; It is said that
the papers concealed by Higford, and which led to his conviction,
were discovered under the roof of this building.&nbsp; Several
apartments of very spacious dimensions, but of whose existence
the inhabitants were totally ignorant, were discovered through
accident, by a maid servant about 20 years since.&nbsp; The
chapel now used as a wash-house, is still quite perfect, and of
great height: several niches for the statues of saints, and
receptacles for holy water, may be discovered in the sides:
through the falling of part of the wall, a few years ago, several
Roman coins were dug up, from which circumstance, it has been by
some persons imagined, that the place was originally a Roman
villa.</p>

of an elegant residence, <!-- page 36--><a

was formerly the property of the lords Irvine, and was considered
a very handsome specimen of the domestic architecture of the age,
in which it was erected.&nbsp; It was taken down a few years
since, and no vestige left to mark its site, save the remnants of
a farm house in existence before the building of the mansion
itself, and part of a wing added to the structure, on the
marriage of lord William Ingram, one of the family.</p>

adjacent hills behind, the interesting church appears by far the
most conspicuous object in the wide extended landscape, while the
small and winding branch of the river Arun, which takes its rise
in the adjacent forest of of St. Leonard, contributes not a
little to heighten the beauty, and diversify the scene, of this
truly delightful and extensive prospect.</p>

house, proudly rise upon the sight.&nbsp; <!-- page 38--><a

hill, while the one we have just described preserves the
appellation of Denne (undoubtedly derived from Dane) hill.&nbsp;
The estate formerly belonging to the family of Braose, was
forfeited to the crown, with other lands, on the attainder of
Thomas duke of Norfolk into whose possession it had fallen: in
the year 1594, it was awarded by Sir William Covert and Sir John
Caryll to James Boath, by whom it was sold five years afterwards

by Itchingfield, <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span

1831, 952 inhabitants.&nbsp; The village is lather extensive, and
consists principally of one long narrow street, running N. and
S., the church on the west side is particularly neat, though
exhibiting a variety of style, and consists of a nave and south
aisle, with three chancels: the northern of these latter portions
is divided from the south aisle, by a handsome oaken skreen,
carved in the Gothic style, and formerly belonged to the
Carylls.&nbsp; On the north side is a curious old mural monument,
bearing the effigies of a man in armour and a woman kneeling;
below are 8 smaller figures intended for their children, with
another person armed, in the centre.&nbsp; The inscription
informs us that it was erected to the memory of Sir John Caryll
Knt., eldest son of Thomas Caryll esq. of Warnham, and Maria his
wife, daughter <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span

<p>To the east of Horsham, is a tract of land, containing between
eight and nine thousand acres, called St. Leonard&rsquo;s forest:
although its nearest point is seven miles from the upper part of
Beeding, it is within the limits of that parish: the chief part
of the soil is poor, it contained considerable quantities of iron
stone, which was smelted, but as the timber became exhausted, the
smelting of the iron has been long discontinued, and nothing
remains to denote the former manufactory of cast iron, but
several large ponds in various parts of the forest, still called
Hammer ponds.</p>
<p>This forest has ever been the subject of the legends of
neighbouring peasants, woe (according to their account) to the
luckless wight, who should venture to cross it alone <!-- page

horseback during the night, for no soon will he have entered its
darksome precincts, than a horrible decapitated spectre in the
shape of a former squire Paulett, disregarding all prayers or
menaces, leaps behind him on his good steed, and accompanies the
affrighted traveller to the opposite boundaries.&mdash;The
celebrated St. Leonard also, through whose efficacious
prayers</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The adders never stynge,<br />
Nor ye nyghtyngales synge,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in its gloomy mazes is often the theme of the cottagers fire
side conversation.</p>
<p>But neither ghost, nor cast iron, nor saint Leonard himself,
have gained for this forest so much celebrity as its famous
DRAGON, or serpent!&nbsp; This venemous reptile, which some
persons have rendered into some obnoxious proprietor, has been
honoured with <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span

corruption of it cannot strike the outward parts of a man, unless
heated into blood, yet by receiving it in at any of our breathing
organs, (the nose or mouth) it is by authority of all authors
writing in that kinde, mortal and deadlie; as one thus saith,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Noxia serpentum est admixto sanguine
pestis.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lucan</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The serpent, or dragon as some call it, is reputed to be nine
feete or rather more, in <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>length, and
shaped almost in the forme of an axle-tree of a cart, a quantitie
of thickness in the middest, and somewhat smaller at both
ends.&nbsp; The former part which he shootes forth as a necke, is
supposed to be about an ell long, with a white ring as it were of
scales about it.&nbsp; The scales along his backe, seeme to be
blackish, and so much as is discovered under his bellie,
appeareth to be red: for I speak but of no nearer description
than a reasonable ocular distance; for coming too neare, it hath
already been too dearely paid for, as you shall heare
hereafter.&nbsp; It is likewise discovered to have large feete,
but the eye may be deceved, for some suppose that serpents have
no feete, but glide along upon certain ribbes and scales, which
both defend them from the upper part of the throat unto the lower
part of their bellie, and also cause them to <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>move much the
faster.&nbsp; For so this doth, and rids away as we call it, as
fast as a man can run.&nbsp; He is of countenance very proud, and
at the sight or heareing of men and cattle, will raise his necke
upright, and seem to listen and looke about with great
arrogancie.&nbsp; There are likewise on either side of him
discovered two great bunches, so big as a large footeball, and as
some think will grow to wings, but God I hope will so defend the
poor people in the neigbourhood, that he shall be destroyed,
before he growe so fledge.&mdash;He will cast his venome about 4
roddes from him, as by woeful experience it was proved on the
bodies of a man and woman coming that way, who afterwards were
found dead, being poysoned and very much swelled, but not preyed
upon.&nbsp; Likewise a man going to chase it and as he imagined
to destroy it with two mastiff dogs as yet not <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>knowing the
great danger thereof, his dogs were both killed, and he himself
glad to returne with haste to preserve his own life: yet this is
to be noted that the dogs were not preyed upon, but slaine and
left whole, for his food is thought to be for the most part in a
conie warren, which he often frequents, and it is found to be
much scanted and impaired, in the encrease it had wont to
afford.&mdash;These persons, whose names are here under printed,
have scene this serpent, besides divers others, as the carrier of
Horsam, who lieth at the White Horse, in Southwark, and who can
certifie the truth of all that hath been herein
related.&mdash;</p>

<p>Proceeding from Horsham along the London road, and passing

delightful and elegant mansion of the Marchioness of Northampton:
the vicinity of this seat was lately rendered particularly
interesting by a romantic and beautiful glen called
Dubbin&rsquo;s Green, one of the wildest and most secluded spots
in the district, but it is greatly to be lamented, the enclosing
of the adjacent common, has almost entirely destroyed the beauty
of the scenery, and robbed the visitor of a <!-- page 53--><a

for some distance, and then inclining to the right, the pretty
little village of Nuthurst, with its modest spire peeping amidst
the lowly cottages <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span

display before the sight.&nbsp; To the east of the parish is a
portion of St. Leonard&rsquo;s forest, and a part of the parish
of Cowfold: to the west Horsham, and part of Broadwater; to the
north another portion of the forest; and south Cowfold.&nbsp; The
district is peculiarly rich and beautiful, abounding in springs
of excellent water in every direction.&nbsp; The church, of the
time of Edward III, and dedicated to St. Andrew, is in the early
style of English architecture, with a low tower, containing 3
bells, and surmounted by a low shingled spire, at the west
end.&nbsp; The roof is pannelled in a similar manner to the
church at Horsham; the ribs and knots of two pannels are gilt and
painted.&nbsp; The communion window contains remnants of stained
glass, representing the Salvator Mundi, and two angels scattering
incense.&nbsp; <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span

<p>Near Nuthurst in a very delightful situation, commanding
extensive views of the sea and south downs, is Nuthurst Lodge,
the residence of James Tuder Nelthorpe esq.: at a very short
distance from the mansion, are the remains of an ancient castle
or hunting seat, surrounded by an oute <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>and inner
moat, of a circular form, and traceable everywhere; the
foundations of the walls are quite visible, and one apartment of
a sexagonal shape is entirely perfect.&nbsp; About 40 yards
farther on, surrounded by copse wood, and over hanging trees, is
a small well of a circular form, and surrounded by cut stone
overgrown by moss: a flight of winding steps, leading to it, from
an adjacent eminence, adds a peculiarly romantic and pleasing
effect to this venerable work of antiquity, which is known by the
name of the Nun&rsquo;s Well.&nbsp; No account is to be found of
its history, though it may perhaps have belonged to the
neighbouring castle.&nbsp; The traditions among the inhabitants
affirm, that a subterraneous passage connects this castle with
the nunnery at Rusper, which is 8 miles distant, but no attempt
has been undertaken to ascertain the truth of this
conjecture.&nbsp; <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Passing over Tower Hill, an eminence
near Horsham, we arrive at the village of Itchingfield, or
Hethinfield as it was formerly called.&nbsp; The earliest notice
of this place, is to be found in an ancient deed A.D. 1233, when
&ldquo;Hugh de Mabel and Susanna his wife, sold to Robert atte
Feching, one messuage and half a carucate of land, at
Hethinfield.&rdquo;&nbsp; The parish is bounded on the east by
Horsham, south by Shipley, west by Shipley, and north by
Slinfold, and contained in 1831, 349 inhabitants.&nbsp; The
church dedicated to St. Nicholas is of the time of Henry III, or
Edward the I.&nbsp; Its exterior is particularly rustic
especially the low tower at the west end, which is formed of
entire trunks of trees fastened together by wooden bolts.&nbsp;
Against one of the walls of timber in the belfry is an ancient
painting representing Moses receiving the ten commandments <!--

Wheatly gent, ob. 1668, and some members of his family, who were
nearly allied to the Mitchells of Field place.&nbsp; <!-- page
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>There
is also another inscription to the memory of the Rev. Alexander
Hay, former rector of the parish, 1724, also several of his
children.&nbsp; Dallaway mentions that after the Scotch rebellion
in 1715, some of the attained persons took refuge in the woods of
Itching field, and were permitted to reside with their countryman
Alexander Hay; indeed we can hardly imagine a more suitable place
for concealment, than the parsonage house, situated as it was at
that time, in the centre of a dense forest, through which there
was hardly any passable road.</p>
<p>The last monumental inscription is for the Rev. Thomas
Lavender a most exemplary minister of this parish, for upwards of
60 years, he died in the year 1776, at the age of 86.</p>
<p>The font is modern, but particularly neat and handsome; one of

deserve attention, and the sweetly retired situation of the
fishing house, erected upon the banks of a lake surrounded by the
majestic and noble trees for which this district is so justly
celebrated, whilst the deep silence which pervades the whole,
interrupted only by the rippling stream beneath, and the
delightful choir of the feathered songsters, combine to render
it, in every sense of the word, a most enchanting and delightful

<p>This parish which is bounded on the east by Warnham, west by
Rudgewick and Billinghurst, north by Rudgewick, and south by
Itchingfield, approaches nearer in form to a circle than any
other, and is intersected in several directions by 3 turnpike
roads.&nbsp; From the excellent slate quarries in the vicinity,
slabs containing 100 square feet, and about 5 in thickness have
often been raised.&nbsp; Several rare botanical plants are found
in this parish, some indigenous, and others originally introduced

science.</p>
<p>The late eminent antiquary Mr. Warton, observes in his history

the Stane street, a Roman road, going from Arundel, if not from
the sea side through Dorking to London.&nbsp; The dorsum not
intended for heavy carriages consists of sea gravel and sea
pebbles abounding on the Sussex coast, above 3 feet deep, and 7
yards long: these minute materials must have been amassed with
prodigious labour.</p>

<p>The strata around Horsham, (which is situated in the Wealden
formation) are celebrated for the abundance of the exuvi&aelig;,
of large saurian animals.&mdash;Many of the bones of the
Iguanadon, an enormous reptile, which was formerly an inhabitant
of these districts, are now in the possession of Mr G. B. Holmes,
of Horsham, by whom these particulars are obligingly
communicated.&nbsp; The animal which more nearly approximates to
it, than any other now in existence, is the Iguana Cornuta a
native of the tropical parts of America, and from its resemblance
to which it has received its name; but more particularly on
account of the teeth of the Iguanadon, which resemble those of no
other animal than the Iguana, of which one species (the Cornuta,)
has, like the Iguanadon, a single horn.&nbsp; If we take the
Iguana as our model, and attempt to reconstruct the enormous
Iguanadon in just proportion, from the relics which have been
frequently exhumed, we shall produce a monster 100 feet in
length, which there is every reason to believe is not an
exaggeration.&mdash;Besides the Iguanadon, we find the bones of
the crocodile, the Plesiosaurus, the turtle, and other amphibious
reptiles; with the carbonized remains of monocotyledoneous
plants, arborescent ferns, and palms, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>ROADS.</h2>
<p>Horsham, though at present remarkable for the excellent state
of its turnpike roads, was, before the year 1750, one of most
extraordinary instances of non communication in the kingdom:
previously to the abovementioned period, the London road was so
execrably bad, that whoever went there on wheels, was compelled
to go round by Canterbury!</p>
<p>It is intended to make the great London and Brighton rail road
pass through the town, which cannot fail to encreas the business
and traffic of the place.</p>

<p>The fairs of Horsham are on April 5th: Monday before

Cherry fair; Sep. 5th. cattle: Nov. 27th. cattle and toys.&nbsp;
Last Tuesday in every month, for cattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicholas Hostresham, whose name is contracted to
Horsham, may justly be placed in this town, as descended from it;
families of note often taking their names from their places of
residence; and if that be admitted, he will give some lustre to
it, for he was a very learned man, and so famous a physician,
that the nobility coveted his company on any conditions, so high
an esteem had they for him.&nbsp; It seems it was something of a
peculiar art in him, to cure and yet to please his patient, which
he would not do nevertheless it was consistent with the disease;
for his aim was, to cure and please if possible, but displease if
unavoidable.&nbsp; He was of a middle temper, neither so rough as
to affright, <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>nor so gentle, as to humour his
patient into his own destruction; so that he was almost two
physicians in one man.&nbsp; He died in the year 1448.&rdquo;</p>

74</span>APPENDIX</h2>
<p>Having principally confined the limits of the foregoing
account, to a circle of about 4 or 5 miles around the town of
Horsham, we have omitted previously to notice the priory of
Rusper, a building of great antiquity, and closely connected with
that borough, by the endowment of the church to its nuns.&nbsp;
Very little of the ancient edifice remains at present, I shall
therefore insert a very brief account of the nunnery, as given by
Sir William Burrell, in his interesting MSS. preserved in the
British Museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the north wing of the east front of the nunnery,
towards the orchard, the foundations of additional building, and
the arch of a cellar are visible, 58 feet in extent, and east of
the present house.&nbsp; It is probable a similar wing was on the
south aspect and thereby formed a Greek II.&nbsp; The ancient
apple trees which cover the flank, render such an idea very
problematical.&rdquo;&nbsp; Near the building is a very deep
well, said to have been used as a place of destruction for those
members of the convent, who had dared to break their vows of
chastity.</p>
<p>Near Mrs Delves tomb at Horsham, is the headless brass figure
of an ecclesiastic, supposed from the letters T C in the cope, to
cover the remains of Thomas clerk, a former rector.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
